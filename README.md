# Named-Entity-Recognition
The most common data preprocessing activity is named entity recognition (NER). It entails locating important information in the text and classifying it into a number of predetermined categories. A constant subject of discussion or reference in a book is referred to as an entity.
NER is a variation of NLP.
The two steps that make up the fundamental process of NLP are as follows:
-Identifying items in the text
-Putting them into various categories

Some of the categories that make up NER's most significant architecture include:
Identifier: Person Organisation Location
Among other frequent jobs is classifying the following:
-Date/time.
-Expression
-Money, percentages, weight, and other numerical measurements
-Inbox address

The open-source Python package SpaCy is used for natural language processing (NLP). It offers effective and quick tools for a variety of NLP tasks, including dependency parsing, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, tokenization, and more. SpaCy is made to be simple to use, scalable, and suitable for production.

A well-liked open-source Python package for natural language processing (NLP) is called NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). For tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, machine learning, and others, it offers a wide range of tools, resources, and features.

While NLTK offers more flexibility and instructional support, SpaCy excels at performance-critical and production-level NLP jobs. To choose the library that best meets the needs, take into account the unique requirements and priorities. Utilising the advantages of both libraries for various components of NLP pipeline may occasionally be advantageous.
